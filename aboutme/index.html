    <h2>Logan Gauruder</h2>
    <p>Hello, my name is Logan Gauruder. This is my second semester at BYU-Idaho <br/> after transferring from BYU-Provo. I'm majoring in Cybersecurity because I want <br /> to make a difference in the security and protection of people in digital spaces.</p>
    <p>I have taken a few Web Development courses in the past so this course is a bit <br /> of a refresher as well as something to help me progress forward towards <br /> my Bachelor's degree.</p>
    <p>In my free time, I enjoy listening to podcasts, reading, playing video games, <br /> weight training, and spending time with friends and family.</p>
